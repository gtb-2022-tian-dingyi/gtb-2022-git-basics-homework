# Self-introduction

- hello,stranger.

- My name is Dingyi Tian.I was born in 2000.That's right,maybe I 'm the youngest person to enter the workplace.

- I studied in Xi'an University of Electronic Science and technology and my major is information engineering, that is, communication engineering.

- But I once worked as a back-end intern in Ali, and now I have become a  "programmer".

- Of course, I have a wide range of interests.I  basically cover ball games and board games.

- Besides, I also like music.I have my own radio station (now called podcast) in Netease cloud(网易云).If you are interested in my voice, you can search "人间的分贝" on Netease cloud.But I'm not a musician yet. So I can only record in the form of podcasts.
